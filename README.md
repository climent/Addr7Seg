# Addr7Seg
Control library for Sean Hodgins addressable 7-segment display.

This library implements a more clean and modular code to control the addressable 7-segments display that Sean Hodgins developed and that can be found here https://www.hackster.io/seanhodgins/addressable-7-segment-displays-26bbfb

This code is a mashup between the code he originally wrote and Adafruit's NeoPixel library. Some methods have been literally or almost literally copied from that library.

Currently the library is quite crude, with several hardcoded values that reflect or extend the hardcoded values present on the original code.
